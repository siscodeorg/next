# next

Repository for storing ideas as issues.

Mainly an extension of #project_discussion so that ideas can be put under permanent storage until they are concretely implemented on each of their projects.  
The rule of thumb is that "Abstract ideas" go here, some discussion happens here/discord and later its implemented on the project and closed here.

`Project Name` - Idea

thats it. a description would be helpful but thats not a requirment. go ham.

Pinned messages were used for that, but that really isn't the best place for it.  
This makes that pinned issues are stuff being adressed **NOW** and so can be 
focused and removed as they go, and we don't end up with stale clutter on a fast moving chat.  

It also makes ideas queryable and more visible on #git_spam instead of having to click on pins.  
Since all stuffed added here should have been discussed prior to that, this also act as a todo list.

As a bonus trivia point, this is repository is also an idea. lel.
